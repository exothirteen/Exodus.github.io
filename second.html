One of the earliest occurrences took place between 4400–3600 BC on the island of Malta. 
                    It was also found carved into the tomb of Newgrange in Ireland, which was constructed around 3200 BC. Interestingly, it was also found on Greek ships from the Mycenaean phase of the Bronze Age. The Triple Spiral made many appearances across Europe over the years. One of the more notable examples 
                    is in a carving in a settlement in the northwestern regions of the Iberian Peninsula. There’s also evidence of the symbol in Gothic architecture which was popular during the 12th to 16th century. As is the case with many Celtic Knots and symbols, the Triskele meaning varies greatly, depending on 
                    what you ready and who you speak to. Records from back when these symbols were used are light to say the least, so interpretation plays a big part in deciphering the Celtic Triskele symbol meaning.  [1]</p>
